= EcoToxFred - Dialogues with a Knowledge Keeper

Here, we present EcoToxFred, a Neo4j-backed Chatbot with whom you can discuss environmental monitoring data collected in a large knowledge graph and stored in a Neo4j Graph Database.

*EcoToxFred is a prototype* that demonstrates how domain-specific knowledge can be combined with LLMs to facilitate the interaction of researchers, stakeholders, or general users with the knowledge.

<img align="left" style="margin-right:10px;" src="figures/assistant.png"> EcoToxFred can answer questions about chemicals and their measured concentrations in European surface waters like rivers and lakes. 
EcoToxFred is a friendly and intuitive chatbot designed to help researchers, stakeholders, and users explore and analyze chemical concentrations and toxicity data in European surface waters. 
By leveraging advanced language models and a graph database, EcoToxFred makes complex environmental toxicology data accessible and understandable for everyone, regardless of technical background.

In its currently trained state, it can

- provide general information about rivers, lakes, or substances
- provide sampling sites where individual (sets of) chemicals have been measured and detected at which concentrations
- plot measured concentrations across time and/or sampling sites
- find all substances measured at a certain sampling site (identified by country, water body, or coordinate range)
- identify the most frequent drivers in regions (countries, water bodies, Europe)
- extract summarized risk for regions or species

== Running the application

To run the application, you must install the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

[source,sh]
pip install -r requirements.txt


Then run the `streamlit run` command to start the app on link:http://localhost:8501/[http://localhost:8501/^].

[source,sh]
streamlit run bot.py

== Contributing

You may experience that *EcoToxFred* does not provide appropriate responses. Please provide your query and your expected response and we will improve LLM prompts, provide more examples for zero-shot and few-shot learning, and if necessary even make improvements or adjustments to our Neo4j database (e.g., by integrating additional knowledge).
